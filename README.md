# PORTAL 3

## Motto
*When life gives you lemons **don't** make lemonade! Make life take those lemons back! Get MAD! I don't want your dam lemons! What am I supposed to do with these! Demand to see life's manager, make life rule the day trying to get away with giving Cave Johnson Lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the one whose gonna burn your house down, with the lemons. In fact, I should get the lab boys to make a combustible lemon, **THAT'LL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN!***
